Files for the Musix playlist sharing website. These files execute SQL queries to create, edit and delete users
and playlists. You can create an account to become a user, or login as an existing user. You then can choose
to view any of your created playlists. After viewing your playlists, you can also choose to view playlists of
other users that you follow.

- To launch the site, start with login.html. That file calls the other files as requested by the user.

- SQL folder creates sample data to view and test the site. 

Future Work - Add many other functions such as following another user that is not already followed, and better
validation for passwords and usernames.
